#### **CoreData**
 Core data is a framework that allows you to manage model layered objects in an app, and it also lets you persist data as well and I used core data to save the reviews.
 
 ---
  
#### **Notifications**
Notifications allow you to keep track of what is new on the app. I used notifications to remind a user  to use the app again.
 
 ---
#### **API**

API delivers a user response to a system and sends the systemâ€™s response back to a user. I use an API to get an article, review and a image gallery from the GameSpot API to display on the screen.
