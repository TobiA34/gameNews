#### **CoreData**
 Core data is a framework that allows you to manage model layered objects in an app, and it also lets you persist data as well and I used core data to save the reviews.

#### **Notifications**
Notifications allow you to keep track of what is new on the app. I used notifications to remind a user  to use the app again.
